# ☕ Cafe Website  

A simple and visually appealing **coffee shop website** built using **HTML, CSS, and GSAP animations**.  

I came across similar animated websites on reels made by different developers, and I was really impressed. That motivated me to **learn GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** and experiment with smooth, creative animations.  

This is one of my first projects using GSAP — it’s not too complex, but it taught me a lot about how animations bring life to a static website.
